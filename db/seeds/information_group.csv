Note that risks to information and information systems associated with internal risk management and mitigation activities may inherently affect the resistance to compromise/damage and recovery from damage with respect to a broad range of critical infrastructures and key national assets.5,1,C.2.5,Revenue collection,Revenue Collection includes the collection of Government income from all sources. Note: Tax collection is accounted for under the Taxation Management information type in the General Government mission area.6,1,C.2.6,Public affairs,"Public Affairs activities involve the exchange of information and communication between the Federal Government, citizens and stakeholders in direct support of citizen services, public policy, and/or national interest."7,1,C.2.7,Legislative relations,"Legislative Relations involves activities aimed at the development, tracking, and amendment of public laws through the legislative branch of the Federal Government."8,1,C.2.8,General government,"General Government involves the overhead costs of the Federal Government, including legislative and executive activities; provision of central fiscal, personnel, and property activities; and the provision of services that cannot reasonably be classified in any other service support area. As a normal rule, all activities reasonably or closely associated with other service support areas or information types shall be included in those service support areas or information types rather than listed as a part of general government. This service support area is reserved for central government management operations; most service delivery (mission-based) management activities would not be included here. Unlike the other service support functions, some general government information types are associated with specific organizations (e.g., Department of the Treasury, Executive Office of the President, Internal Revenue Service)."9,2,C.3.1,Administrative management,"Administrative Management involves the day-to-day management and maintenance of the internal infrastructure. Administrative information is usually routine and is relatively low impact. However, some administrative management information is either very sensitive (e.g., logistics management for nuclear or other hazardous materials, security management information, and security clearance management information) or critical (e.g., inventory control and logistics management information needed to support time-critical operations). National security information is outside the scope of this guideline. [See Appendix A, Glossary of Terms, for a definition of national security information/systems.] Routine administrative management information systems that do not process classified information are not usually designated national security systems, even if they are critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions."10,2,C.3.2,Financial management,"Financial management involves the aggregate set of accounting practices and procedures that allow for the accurate and effective handling of all government revenues, funding, and expenditures. Confidentiality impacts associated with financial management information are generally associated with the sensitivity of the existence of specific projects, programs, and/or technologies that might be revealed by unauthorized disclosure of information. For integrity, temporary successful frauds can affect agency image, and corrective actions are often disruptive to agency operations. Permanent loss/unavailability of financial management information can cripple agency operations."11,2,C.3.3,Human resource management,Human resource management activities involve all activities associated with the recruitment and management of personnel.12,2,C.3.4,Supply chain management,"Supply chain management involves the purchasing, tracking, and overall management of goods and services."13,2,C.3.5,Information and technology management,"IT management involves the coordination of IT resources and systems required to support or enable a citizen service. Impacts to information associated with the operation of IT systems generally need to be considered even when all mission-related information processed by the system is intended to be available to the general public. The relevant issues may be different for integrity and availability than for confidentiality. Information that has been made public, by definition, requires no confidentiality protection. In contrast, integrity and availability protection cannot be maintained for copies of information that have been distributed to the public. Integrity and availability assurance can only be maintained by maintaining copies of information in organization-controlled information systems."14,3,D.1,Defense and national security,"Defense and national security operations protect and advance U.S. National Security interests and, if deterrence fails, decisively defeat threats to those interests. Defense and national security activities include military operations, border protection, and intelligence gathering.

Systems that, involve command and control of military forces, weapons control29, involve equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system, are critical to the direct fulfillment of military missions or are otherwise employed in strictly military operations30 are defined under Public Law as national security systems. National security information and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline. Information assurance responsibilities are delegated to the Department of Defense for systems that are operated by the Department of Defense, or another entity on behalf of the Department of Defense31. Security objectives and impact levels associated with these systems are determined by the Department of Defense."15,3,D.2,Homeland security,"Homeland Security involves protecting the nation against terrorist attacks.
